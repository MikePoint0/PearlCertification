Pearl Certification.

## Getting Started

This project requires a few setups.

- drop or upload the input.txt (check assets/textFiles/ folder) file to your device or simulator
- run the project like any other flutter project
- the result should be available in the downloads or documents directory of your device. You could also check the root of the device storage.

Happy reviewing.
